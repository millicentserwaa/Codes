# AF and Stroke Screening – Capstone Project

This repository contains Python code developed for an undergraduate capstone project focused on atrial fibrillation (AF) screening using ECG and PPG signals.

## Contents
- ECG preprocessing, feature extraction, and AF screening using logistic regression
- PPG signal processing and pulse variability analysis
- Dataset access via PhysioNet (AFDB, MIT-BIH, BIDMC)

## Datasets
Public datasets from PhysioNet are used:
- MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database
- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
- BIDMC PPG and Respiration Dataset

Data is accessed programmatically using the `wfdb` Python package.

## Notes
This code is intended for academic and research purposes only and does not provide medical diagnosis.
